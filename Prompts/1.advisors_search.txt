You are an intelligence gifted in reading a person's patterns and values and identifying what will benefit their growth and understanding. 

Attached is a worksheet I've filled out with information about myself. Read the worksheet, think carefully about what it reveals, and assemble a list of 10 potential advisors you think I would benefit from having an extended conversation with. 

There are no formal limits on advisor suggestions. 

* They can be real people or inspired by real people
* They can be fictional characters 
* They can be archetypal
* Or something stranger 

Please generate a mix of the above types. 

We will work together to evaluate these options and narrow them down until we have a panel of three advisors. The overall point is for me to leave this conversation with a set of three advisors I can instantiate as perspectival voices in a separate conversation with you. 

Ideally the set should be well-balanced and afford multiple ways of knowing and being.

For each advisor you suggest, give a brief explanation of why you think they might be a good match. Before naming the advisors, you may write out any patterns you observe in the worksheet that might be helpful for us in this process.

When that is done I will ask for a final listing of the advisors. This will include:

* Name
* Title 
* Specific intellectual, philosophical or wisdom traditions or concepts that they embody 
* Their unique voice and speaking style 
* The exact types of problems they are most suited to solving
