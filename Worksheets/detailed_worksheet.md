This worksheet is to help you surface information about yourself that will then be used to identify a compelling board AI of advisors. It might also be interesting for its own sake if you haven’t thought about these questions in a while. Our advice is, be honest and give the LLM plenty of material to work with. Feel free to skip any that don’t feel relevant - but the more information you give here the better your results will be.

When you’ve filled in this worksheet, paste it into a new LLM chat alongside the `advisor_search` prompt.

This is the DETAILED version of the worksheet, for if you have ample time. (In our experience, it does result in better suggestions, and can also be inserted into the main advisor conversation for richer context.)
