This worksheet is to help you surface information about yourself that will then be used to identify a compelling board AI of advisors. It might also be interesting for its own sake if you haven’t thought about these questions in a while. Our advice is, be honest and give the LLM plenty of material to work with. Feel free to skip any that don’t feel relevant - but the more information you give here the better your results will be.

When you’ve filled in this worksheet, paste it into a new LLM chat alongside the `advisor_search` prompt.

This is the BASIC version of the worksheet, for the time-limited.

1. Name up to three areas of your life and how you would like to work on them. (Example: Career - I want to start an interior design practice; Physical Health - I’d like to do a handstand; Personal - I’d like to create a warm and inviting home environment).

Bravery and Beauty in Writing - I want to swiftly draft compelling, wonderful visions in prose. I want to be brave enough to ask for what I want, and to paint a vision for how we will get there. Brave enough to say the truth, even if it is embarrassing.

Business, Building a Tech Campus - I know I can build the most successful tech campus on earth -- even greater than Silicon Valley. In order to do so, I must focus on the core of my business: great people, wonderful environments, superior education, and the hacker ethos.

2. Name up to three real people, living or dead, who you find inspiring. What do you admire about each of them? 

Alexander Hamilton - He shaped a nation with his writing, and was never afraid to speak his mind, even if it offended. He trusted himself, he trusted his intuition as a man, and he knew that the only way to continue to become the best in the world was to refine that intuition by committing to it, publicly, in writing.

Alan Kay - He was a polymath, and a prolific designer and computer scientist. He read so many of the most important books, and he actually understood them enough to embed their lessons in a product. He understood the importance of culture and teams and context more than anybody, and attributes the brilliant success of the computer to the most brilliant social context in history. This is also my work, I need to build the brilliant social context.

Maria Montessori - She understood how children need environments where they are the master. They need to feel in charge. And yet, instead of going full unschool, she took a scientific approach to material design. Of course children should be the master of their own environment and experience, but of course they should have access to all the greatest insights and breakthroughs of science in the form of well-designed materials. We should expect nothing less of our environments, and we must continue to build demonstrations of the greatest insights (really - properties, facts, of the universe) into easy-to-understand sequences of materials and exercises.

3. Name up to three fictional characters you resonate with, and say what feels notable about each of them.

Dalinar Kholin - Dalinar embodies the virtues of strength and honor. He shows that oaths held by strong men can hold nations together via the strongest of bonds. There is no bond stronger than an oath, if we maintain our honor, and as long as honor lives, we can bind worlds, peoples, marriages, armies, or ANYTHING together with oaths. We can solve any coordination problem.

4. Name up to three “viewquake books” that have helped shape your worldview.

The Absorbent Mind, by Maria Montessori
The Elon Musk Post Series, by Tim Urban
The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, by Richard Hamming

5. Name any philosophical or wisdom traditions that you practice or are interested in.

Virtue Ethics - I believe we understand the good by observing it in the world, where it is obvious, via aesthetics and beauty. I believe pursuing that good, pursuing the greatest good we can see in all aspects, is the height of virtue and the height of a good life, well lived.

6. Say three words about the type of person that you are interested in becoming or find inspiring.

brave, responsible, adventurous, playful
